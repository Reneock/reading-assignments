Creating a site.....

Use the table tag to help with items at the foot.
you could embed the table tag with images or videos

also you can place different contents and a side image 
in different categories in a table.

always advisable to put realted information into div's and sections.
nb...when you are writing a class e.g about me for a div or section
and it has two names, type "about-me" or "about_me" instead of "about me"
